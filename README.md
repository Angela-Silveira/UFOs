# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The contained analysis allows the user to further study data collected specific to UFO sightings. Users have the ability to filter data based on city, state, or country of sighting and/or type of sighting (re: shape). ![Filters.png](images/filters.png)
## Results
Users may be looking to learn more about UFO sightings reported in a particular city (perhaps their hometown or current residence). They could also broaden their search to include sightings reported in their entire state to learn if there are perhaps clusters of sightings in neighboring towns. Those users traveling may also be interested in learning about sightings reported in particular countries they are interested in visiting and could apply that specific filter. If a user has experienced a sighting for themself, they might be interested to search for sightings of similar visual shapes related to their own experience. 
## Summary
This particular site relies on quick user input since the data will refresh based on a detected to change to any one field. If a user pauses to consider additional filters, the data might apply the first filter and refresh. The initial design with one filter (date) included a user-input action of clicking a button, indicating they were ready to have the filter applied so the user is in control of when the dataset refreshes. 
One recommendation for further development is the addition of button (or buttons) that allow the user to control when the filters are applied/data refreshes. 
Another recommendation would be to develop a sort function that allows the user to sort filtered results (alphabetically or chronologically).

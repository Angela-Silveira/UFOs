# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The contained analysis allows the user to further study data collected specific to UFO sightings. Users have the ability to filter data based on city, state, or country of sighting and/or type of sighting (re: shape).

## Results
Users may be looking to learn more about UFO sightings reported in a particular city (perhaps their hometown or current residence).

They could also broaden their search to include sightings reported in their entire state to learn if there are perhaps clusters of sightings in neighboring towns.

Those users traveling may also be interested in learning about sightings reported in particular countries they are interested in visiting and could apply that specific filter.

If a user has experienced a sighting for themself, they might be interested to search for sightings of similar visual shapes related to their own experience.

## Summary
One drawback of this particular page/dataset may be difficult to navigate with input. For example, the shapes are a category with a handful of options that may be easier to offer a drop down menu (rather than a user blindly guessing for shapes not included). Similarly with country, only two countries have entries (US & CA), so it would make more sense to offer a drop down menu rather than offering a blank slate of "country." Geographically, the dataset does not include most citites (or even every state - RI is UFO free!) so a user attempting to input cities such as Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville may be frustrated by the lack of results before sorting by Florida instead. 
One recommendation for further development is the opportunity for user to input a date range or multiple inputs (such as multiple cities). 
Another recommendation would be to develop a sort function that allows the user to sort filtered results (alphabetically or chronologically).
